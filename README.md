## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to generate a team summary webpage, through NodeJS CLI via inquirer. The user/manager is prompted for their details. After they are done with their own details
they have the chance to enter details for an employee, starting with that employee's role within the company, name, email, and then based on whether or not they are an engineer or intern the last question
deviates from the basic questions. I was given a JS file that renders the HTML after the details are fed in. All employees inherit from an Employee superclass.
